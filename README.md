# spoken_to_written_english

This is a Python module which can that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english.

 For example, "two dollars" should be converted to $2. Abbreviations spoken as "C M" or "Triple A" should be written as "CM" and "AAA" respectively.


## Here are some possible future functionalities that  can be covered in the future versions of the module:

1.   If the paragraph contains a money figure e.g. two million three thousand nine hundred and eighty-four then we may convert it to numbers as 2003984.

2.  Handling of Dates e.g. Today's Date is twenty-eight October two thousand twenty as Today's Date is 28-10-2020/2020-10-28.

3. Handling of Punctuation.
